# 2022.08.00 - In Development

## Bugs

- Fix for [reflex-api#229](https://github.com/reflexsoar/reflex-api/issues/229) - When a Case Template had no tasks the UI would not display any Case Templates on the Case Templates Management page 

## Features

- First release of Detections
- Event Rule priority now allows users to assign an order to how Event Rules are processed

## Enhancements

- Changes to UI components to be in align with WCAG 2.1
- Event Bulk Ingest now uses a pool of Memcached clients instead of spawning a new client per bulk ingest request.  This is a performance enhancement and a bug fix, the previous method was exhausting available TCP ports.
- Added documentation for Organizations
- Added documentation for Detections
- Agent List now shows Agent Healthy and lists any issues with the agent
- Event Rule List has had columns reworked to reduce screen space, now also shows who created and modified a rule
- Added the ability to control JWT expiration in tenant global settings
- When selecting a close reason for Event dismissal, the Dismiss Comment will automatically fill with the Close Reason description
- New default close reasons and changes to descriptions
- When new default Reflex values are added in the future they will populate across all organizations (e.g. new Close/Dismiss Reasons)
- The API will now wait for a Case to finish creating before redirecting users to the Case page.  Fixes an issue with a Case paged serving a 404.
- Allow `InCIDR` to accept an array of CIDR ranges not only a single string
