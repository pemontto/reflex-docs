# 2022.08.00 - In Development

## Bugs

- Fix for [reflex-api#229](https://github.com/reflexsoar/reflex-api/issues/229) - When a Case Template had no tasks the UI would not display any Case Templates on the Case Templates Management page 

## Features

- First release of Detections

## Enhancements

- A new Event Worker monitor will respawn Event Workers that have been subject to crashing
- Changes to UI components to be in align with WCAG 2.1
- Event Bulk Ingest now uses a pool of Memcached clients instead of spawning a new client per bulk ingest request.  This is a performance enhancement and a bug fix, the previous method was exhausting available TCP ports.
- Added documentation for Organizations
- Added documentation for Detections
- Agent List now shows Agent Healthy and lists any issues with the agent
- Event Rule List has had columns reworked to reduce screen space, now also shows who created and modified a rule
