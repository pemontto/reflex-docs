## Bugs
- Fix for [reflex-api#207](https://github.com/reflexsoar/reflex-api/issues/207) - Pattern based intel lists were not matching Events on ingest or when running as part of an Event Rule criteria.  Pattern matching logic was missing entirely after a previous re-architecting of the Event Rule/Event Processing pipeline.
- Fix for [reflex-api#206](https://github.com/reflexsoar/reflex-api/issues/206) - Adding an observable to a list from an Event Card would not work when the target Event/Observable were a sub-tenant
- Fix for [reflex-api#198](https://github.com/reflexsoar/reflex-api/issues/198) - Unable to delete a User Role from the UI
- Fix for [reflex-api#199](https://github.com/reflexsoar/reflex-api/issues/199) - When the default admin user is left off the Organization creation wizard, organization creation fails
- Fix for [reflex-api#163](https://github.com/reflexsoar/reflex-api/issues/163) - Agent connections using the `elasticsearch` distribution on inputs were failing to establish connections to due to changes in how Elasticsearch handles connection creation
