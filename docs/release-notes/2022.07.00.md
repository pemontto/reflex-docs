## Bugs

- Fix for [reflex-api#196](https://github.com/reflexsoar/reflex-api/issues/196) - The Audit Logs would not displayed correctly in the System > Settings > Audit Logs tab due to an issue with the `ip_approved` route decorator
- Fix for [reflex-api#194](https://github.com/reflexsoar/reflex-api/issues/194) - When deleting a user their e-mail was preserved and could not be re-used when making a new user.  When a user is deleted now the soft-deleted user will have their email set to `None`
