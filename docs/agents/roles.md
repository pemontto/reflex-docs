# Agent Roles

Agents can take on several different roles, allowing each agent to perform different functions.  

The default roles are:

- `runner` - A runner will execute ad-hoc actions and playbook actions against defined resources
- `poller` - A poller will look to defined inputs for new data and push that data to ReflexSOAR as an Event
- `detector` - A detector agent will run Detection Rules against defined inputs
